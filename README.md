# BowVision

Program that uses the webcam and draws out a line representing bow movement, ultimately helping musicians to visualize their their bow placement. This not only helps with artistry, as we are better able to see the different angles and dips that we make with the string, but also helps with releasing tension in the arm (a major problem in bow technique), as we can concentrate on creating a certain shape rather than trying to relax taught muscles.
